===================
This app was created as a follow along to a [Code Coalition](https://www.codecoalition.com/) iOs tutorial.  It allows you to request to view a new dog and randomly chooses a picture of a dog while displaying the breed and the dog's name.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
+ To see the app:
  - Clone this repo.
  - Make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.
  - Open the app in Xcode.
  - Select the iPhone Retina(4 inch).
  - Hit play in Xcode.
  - Then you can hit "New Dog" to see a different dog pic. ***Remember, the images are chosen at random and there are only a handful of them so if it seems like no new dog is showing, it probably just selected the same one.  Click "New Dog" a few times to see a different dog.
  - You should also see some output in the console.
